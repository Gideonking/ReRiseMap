# ReRiseMap

This project was developed at the [Hacking for Humanity Romania 2018](https://www.girlswhocode.ro/hacking-for-humanity-2018/).

Our team worked on developing a website for the [Re:Rise](https://web.facebook.com/ReRise.org/) NGO

## Project structure
The website consists of 3 parts:
1. Lading page - presentation website
2. Map for localizing people endangered after the earthquake
3. (experimental, in development) Map for showing buildings destroyed by the earthquake, by comparing images obtained from drones.


Technologies used: Laravel, Google Maps API, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
